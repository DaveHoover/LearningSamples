Media Encoder Profile Information and Generation:

The media profiles included in this folder should be copied to the following folder on the machine where you will run this application.

D:\Program Files\Windows Media Components\Encoder\Profiles

The path may be different for your machine.

On the Encoder helper application, there is a button that you can select which will open the profile editor. This will allow you to edit or create a new profile.
The media SDK code most easily uses one of these profiles to work with the programming API.

The profiles were taken off of the media encoder saved state information that I had been using for quite some time.
