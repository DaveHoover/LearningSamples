<h1>Summary Information

</h1>
<p>This helper application will perform the following media encoder operations 
on an audio message file that has been stored as a .wav file.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A very high compressed file will be generated, with about a 5kbit data 
	rate. Average file size for a 40 minute message is about 1.6Mbytes</li>
	<li>A good quality compressed file, about 48kbit/second for tape quality 
	audio playback and archive. Average file size for a 40 minute message is 
	about 15 mbytes.</li>
	<li>A lossless encoded file, which can be reconstituted back to the original 
	.wav file. This will be used for burning to a CD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three profiles will be used to create these three output files.</p>
